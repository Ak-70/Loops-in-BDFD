> Before you can use any type of loops, you need to learn [how to escape code](../Escaping.md).

You can use `$sub[1eX;1]` to get as many nines as you want. For example, `$sub[1e10;1]` gives us 10 nines, which is 9999999999. You can then replace each 9 with a piece of code, which will allow you to run the code as many times as you want. However, due to BDFDâ€™s computation limits, this method is limited to 38 nines. For amounts higher than 38, I recommend using [a more advanced method](../Run%20X%20Times/Advanced%20Method.md).

This example deletes the last 3,800 non-pinned messages sent in the last 2 weeks:
```js
$sum[1e38;%{DOL}%clear[100\]]
```

(38 x 100 = 3,800)

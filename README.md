> Before you can use any type of loops, you need to learn [how to escape code](Escaping.md).

# Running a code for each item in a list.
Imagine a list of numbers (1, 24, 7, 3, 19), and your goal is to get rid of every even number bigger than 7. This should be done with a “For Each Loop” because you do something to each item in a list (check if it’s even and bigger than 7). Unsafe method should not be used, if the list is provided by a user.

- [Safe method](For%20Each/Safe%20method.md)
- [Unsafe method](For%20Each/Unsafe%20method.md)

# Running a code a specific amount of times.
Imagine you want to list all even numbers from X to Y. This should be done with this loop because you will be executing a code a specific amount of times. I recommend the first method because it’s easier.

- [`$sub` method](Run%20X%20Times/%24sub.md)
- [`$repeatMessage` method](Run%20X%20Times/%24repeatMessage.md)
- [Advanced method](Run%20X%20Times/Advanced%20method.md)

# Running a code all the time.
An example use case would be a reminder command or a giveaway command. \
